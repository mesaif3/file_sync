context:
    - My friends and I have a minecraft world that only one person has access to the files to host it.

Problem:
    - We cannot play without that person's presence/hosting.

Solution:
    - Create a way to syncronize the files to a common server so anyone can retrieve the files and host it.

Google_Drive_Method:
    Requirements: 
                  - access to a specific google drive directory
                  - a custom server launcher to automate the synchronization and launching of the server.
                  - a shareable executable file.
    
    Steps:
            - Create the google drive directory and partition it to each member (with access).
            - Use python google API to connect to directory.
            - Search for "IN USE" token file.
